# chefs-knife

## Instructions to run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate into the directory (`cd chefs-knife`).
3. Install node modules by running `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn start` to start the server and launch the webpage.
   1. If for some reason the page doesn't automatically load in your default browser, go to the url `localhost:3000` in your browser to access the page.

## Notes about the project
* The page was built for a viewport size of width 1440px. In the future, a major improvement would be updating the page to make it work for a variety of viewports, including making it mobile responsive.
* The main goal was to build the MVP of displaying the sample engraving text on the knife and being able to see it update as the user changes the text, which was achieved. An extra credit project was to make the engraving text scale as the viewport is adjusted, which was also approximately achieved.
* The rest of the page was built mostly for aesthetics, so the directory links and color selection of the knife is not functional. However, I did build a custom select dropdown to play with for changing the quantity.
